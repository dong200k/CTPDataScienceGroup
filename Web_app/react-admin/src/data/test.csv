Data Engineer,$119K-$147K (Glassdoor est.),"Data Engineering at B12

B12's engineering team views software as a craft, but improving the world as the reason to practice it. Our engineers are responsible for prioritizing, conceptualizing, co-designing, building, testing, and engaging users for any concept we are building out. We're generalists in encouraging each other to experience the full stack, but we're also aware of each other's preferences in the stack. We mentor and teach where we can, both inside and outside of the company.

We value sharing our work with the outside world. Our team has published papers on forming expert flash teams and machine-mediated worker hierarchies. We've baked our research into Orchestra, the system that coordinates our expert and machine teams, and released Orchestra into open source to contribute our software back to the community.

We're looking for a Data Engineer to help us answer critical questions our business faces while improving our data systems and architecture to support greater variety, volume, and velocity of data and data sources. We hope our engineers have more longevity than any one tool we use, but here is a sampling of our current thoughts about technology:
We build our product on Python/Django and JavaScript/React.
We store blobs in Amazon's S3, munch on them in Amazon's EC2, develop in Docker, and deploy containers to Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk.
We believe Postgres should be the first system you consider when you think about persisting structured data.
We religiously clean and centralize data in Amazon's Redshift, and are able to answer most any question in SQL. We recently wrote our 1000th query in Metabase!
Before building complex statistical machine learning models, we build simple ones we can understand. Rarely, we build complex models.
We have near-full test coverage on the backend, and are making progress on our frontend and integration tests.
We set up continuous integration and deployment because, while this model comes with its own pains, we've disliked being on fixed release schedules on previous projects.
We like to move fast and support point-in-time recovery :).
As a Data Engineer, you will
Collaborate with operational teams including sales, marketing, and customer success.
Contribute to infrastructure that enables and informs B12's analytical efforts.
Write SQL queries and reusable views that enable various analyses including funnel, retention, and performance reporting.
Use Python to clean data, send it to various systems including our data warehouse and operational services, and perform feature engineering to power the creation of predictive models.
Build rules-based models and statistical machine learning models in Python using packages like scikit-learn.
You'd be a good fit if
You are fluent in SQL and Python.
You have experience building and using data infrastructure, including systems like Postgres and Redshift.
You've used reporting tools like Metabase, Tableau, or Looker in the past.
You know that no dataset is ever pristine, but love to interrogate, structure, and clean data.
You've contributed to extract-transform-load pipelines to collect data from disparate sources and centralize them in a data warehouse.
You feel comfortable managing your time and deciding amongst competing priorities.
You have worked with non-engineering teams and are comfortable explaining technical solutions to them.
You are passionate about the future of work.
You enjoy learning and teaching.
You have strong written and verbal communication skills in English.
You care about and want to contribute to our mission of helping people do meaningful work.
Don't fear

This application of data science examines the drivers of clinical outcomes; analyzes opportunities for managing risk-based populations; evaluates programs and interventions that aim to improve patient outcomes.
Quality How is quality of care measured and how is it related to patient outcomes? Where are opportunities to improve the quality of care to our patients and members? Our data scientists serve as subject matter experts on healthcare quality measurement and risk adjustment; use predictive modeling to identify patient populations in need of clinical interventions; identify opportunities for improvement in clinical processes that can lead to improved quality of care.
Operational How can we optimize our business operations in order to be more efficient? How do we deliver our services in order to improve the coordination of care for our patients and members? This application of data science focuses on efficiency and optimization of business practices in order to improve patient care; uses techniques including time series forecasting and geospatial analysis to address business problems such as staffing and scheduling; analyzes opportunities for business growth within the organization and predicts and forecasts expenses.
Policy What is the impact of health care policy on our patient population? On our most vulnerable patients and members? How will changes in reimbursement policy affect the way we deliver patient care? What partnerships can we develop in order to ensure that our patients and members continue receiving optimal care?

Who You Are:
You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.
You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You are a broadly skilled data scientist with experience embedding models into always-on production systems, working across a variety of technologies and data sources.

You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.
What We Consider as Advantages:
You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.
You are comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.
You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.
You have over 3 years of experience working in a data-driven role.

Our mission is to help people living with chronic conditions make healthier choices every day. Chronic disease is one of the largest challenges facing our nation. This challenge is largely created due to patient non-adherence to medications and care plans. Only about 50% of people with chronic conditions follow their care plan as prescribed. This creates enormous health and economic burdens on individuals, families, and communities that are largely preventable. Our platform deploys evidence-based interventions from behavioral economics through a mobile app to dramatically improve patient adherence, health outcomes, and costs of care. Wellth is at the forefront of designing powerful new tools rooted in behavioral science to deliver value to our customers: healthcare providers and insurers.

Behavioral Economics is at the heart of what we do.

Help us build and scale a platform that is helping hundreds of patients manage their care plan and improve their health. Visit us at www.wellthapp.com for more information.

We have created a smartphone app that uses the power of financial incentives to improve patient adherence. Our technology also provides valuable information to nurses and other healthcare professionals in the form of weekly adherence report cards and real-time alerts to help provide high-touch care to their patients. Patients check in every day by taking a photo of their medications in their hand.
